> ## At first, I want to be your friend 
> ## Now I'm trying to comprehend 
> ## Because I think we can blend 
> ## As long as you don't pretend 

<br>

> ## I'm not asking you to be my girlfriend 
> ## But a broken heart is hard to mend 
> ## Because on you I depend 
> ## Truth is, you're a godsend
