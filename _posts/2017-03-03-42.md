The idea of this painting came into my mind in 2015. I started working on this
project that year when I was still in the tenth grade, but I stopped working on
it when my laptop's graphics card broke. I tried continuing this project in 2016
after I built my own PC. However, not much progress were made and I left it once
more since I was more interested in [other projects](https://laymonage.com/projects).  
Now, in 2017, I revisited this two-year-old project and finally finished it.  

The idea is simple. I've always loved Pink Floyd's legendary Dark Side of the Moon
album, including its simple-but-bold artwork. Pink Floyd were an English rock band
formed in London. There's one iconic building in London that I've always had in mind:
the Big Ben. In my mind, I easily pictured the Big Ben replacing the simple triangle
in the album artwork. So, I googled for an image of the Big Ben and found the one
that's suitable for this project.

Then I looked at the album's artwork for reference, and decided to mirror the Big Ben
image to make the perspective more in line with the artwork.

Then I entirely worked on the lines in vector using almost just the pen tool. I worked
on this for days but I lost count of the hours I worked on this project. Then finally,
I finished it and the result is:

I also created a quick animation for the painting, like this:
