## Installation

<b style="color:red;">Note:</b> LINE has implemented an automatic function that
regularly checks for modified themes, which automatically reverts your theme to default.
This means you'll have to reinstall the theme every time this happens.
{: .notice}

### Method A (easier)
* Install any free theme from Theme Shop (Brown, Cony, Black, or White theme).
* Install [LINE Theme Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hedoturkoglu5tb.ltc3.lite) from Play Store.
* Extract the zip you downloaded from [DeviantArt](http://laymonage.deviantart.com/art/Portal-2-LINE-Theme-549706365).
* Place "themefile.30" somewhere on your phone.
* Open Theme Changer app and tap the + button.
* Select "themefile.30" you just placed.
* Choose the theme you want to replace.
* Apply Original (or any other theme), and reapply the theme you just replaced. You may need to disable your internet connection before doing this.

### Method B
* Install any free theme from Theme Shop (Brown, Cony, Black, or White theme).
* Extract the zip you downloaded from [DeviantArt](http://laymonage.deviantart.com/art/Portal-2-LINE-Theme-549706365).
* Place "themefile.30" somewhere on your phone and copy it.
* Browse to /sdcard/Android/data/jp.naver.line.android/theme.
* Browse to the following folders depending on the theme you want to replace:  
Folder starting with:  
a0768339 = Cony  
ec4a14ea = Brown  
34afc5b4 = Black  
3cc08ba6 = White  
* Paste "themefile.30" into that folder.
* If there's an existing themefile.xx (xx = theme version number) in that folder,
delete it and rename "themefile.30" to "themefile.xx" (with xx being the original number).
* Apply the theme.
